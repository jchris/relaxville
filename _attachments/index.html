      <h2>Welcome to Relaxville!</h2>
      <p>Futon test suite now stores runtime, success and failure information, along with a timestamp and some browser / platform information, into the local database test_suite_reports.

      The test reports are completely private and remain on the localhost for convenient browsing by developers. However, replication makes it easy to share reports.
      </p>

      <p>If you are running this application on your own CouchDB instance, the views are only over the test runs that are on your local machine. Reports are contributed by replicating your <a href="/test_suite_reports">test_suite_reports</a> database to the database at <a href="http://couchdb.couchdb.org/test_suite_reports">http://couchdb.couchdb.org/test_suite_reports</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="#not-yet-implemented">Click this link to contribute your test run data for everyone to browse.</a></p>
      <p>The closest thing to identifying data in the report documents is your timezone and the version of CouchDB you are using. You can <a href="/_utils/database.html?test_suite_reports">view the report documents yourself</a> to be sure you don't send any data to the project that you'd like to keep private. We think the reports are pretty safe to share, hopefully you agree. Please <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/community/lists.html">contact the project</a> if you have any reservations, so we can help put them to rest.</p>
